# ATLAS

Personal **diet and fitness** tracker: daily calories and macros vs your targets, workout log with a weekly session count, and **JSON backup**.

**With Supabase configured** (see below), you sign in with an **email magic link** and your meals, workouts, and targets are stored in your account (Row Level Security so only you can read them). The app still mirrors a copy to `localStorage` on each device as a cache.

**Without Supabase env vars**, the app runs in **offline-only** mode: everything stays in the browser on that device.

The UI is **mobile-first**: thumb-friendly bottom navigation on small screens, safe-area padding for notched devices, `100dvh` layout, 16px+ form fields (avoids iOS zoom on focus), and a [web app manifest](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Manifest) so you can add the site to your home screen.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

### Supabase setup (cloud sync)

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. In **SQL Editor**, run these migrations in order (creates tables, RLS, and the new-user profile trigger):
   - `supabase/migrations/20260418120000_init_tracker.sql` — `profiles`, `meals`, `workouts`
   - `supabase/migrations/20260420200000_lab_abnormals.sql` — `lab_abnormals` (manual lab flags / values per draw)
3. **Authentication → URL configuration**  
   - **Site URL**: `http://localhost:3000` for local dev; your production URL (e.g. `https://atlas-five-pi.vercel.app`) for prod.  
   - **Redirect URLs**: add both  
     `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`  
     `https://YOUR_DOMAIN/auth/callback`
4. **Authentication → Providers**: ensure **Email** is enabled (magic link / OTP).
5. Copy **Project URL** and **anon public** key from **Project Settings → API**.
6. Create `.env.local` from `.env.example` and set:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=eyJ...
```

7. Add the same variables in **Vercel → Project → Settings → Environment Variables**, then redeploy.

The first time you sign in on a device that already had **local-only** data, ATLAS will **upload that snapshot** to your account if the cloud is still empty.

## Live on Vercel

Production: **https://atlas-five-pi.vercel.app**

Redeploy from this machine after changes:

```bash
vercel deploy --prod --yes
```

## GitHub (connect for deploy-on-push)

The default branch is **`main`**. Create an **empty** repo on [GitHub](https://github.com/new) (skip README, license, and `.gitignore` if GitHub offers them—you already have those here), then:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO.git
git push -u origin main
```

Replace `YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO` with your GitHub username and repository name.

**Link Vercel to GitHub** so every push rebuilds the site:

1. Open [Vercel project settings → Git](https://vercel.com/rob-4757s-projects/atlas/settings/git) for this project, click **Connect Git Repository**, and choose the repo you just pushed; or  
2. From this directory after the repo exists: `vercel git connect https://github.com/YOUR_USER/YOUR_REPO.git`
